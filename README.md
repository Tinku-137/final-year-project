Foreign Language Learning through Object Recognition using Artificial Neural Networks

Developing an application(web or app) that uses image classification to identify objects in the user's surroundings. The app then generates flashcards with the object's name in the language the user is learning. This provides a practical and contextual way for language learners to expand their vocabulary.

Real-life Example:
Imagine a user learning Spanish using this app. They take a picture of a table, and the app recognizes it, creating a flashcard with the Spanish word for "table." This way, language learning becomes interactive and applicable to the user'sÂ environment.
